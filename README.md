Best Practices to Prevent Destabilising Transfers of
Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW) through Air Transport
(Agreed at the 2007 Plenary)
Participating States of the Wassenaar Arrangement
Having regard to the Guidelines and Procedures including the Initial Elements
of the Wassenaar Arrangement on Export Controls for Conventional Arms and Dual-
Use Goods and Technologies, and in particular:
- the Best Practice Guidelines for Exports of Small Arms and Light Weapons
(SALW) adopted December 2002;
- the “Elements for Export Controls of Man-Portable Air Defence Systems
(MANPADS)” adopted December 2003 and as amended in 2007.
Recognising that air transport is one of the main channels for the illicit spread of
SALW, particularly to destinations subject to a United Nations arms embargo or
involved in armed conflict;
Considering that some transport companies or agents and their associated
intermediaries employ a range of techniques and strategies to avoid official scrutiny
and legal regulations, such as falsifying transport documentation, concealing
information on the origin of weapons, including cases when they are produced
illegally, or when the origin is not known or questionable, concealing actual flight
plans, routes, and destinations, as well as falsification of aircraft registration or quick
change of registration numbers;
Bearing in mind the 2001 UN Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat and
Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects, and,
where appropriate, the relevant provisions of the 2000 OSCE documents and other
regional initiatives Participating States are party to;
Taking into account existing international standards applicable to air transport,
inter alia, Article 35 and Annex 18 of the Chicago Convention on International Civil
Aviation;
Taking into account existing national legislation regulating the transport by air
of weapons;
Recognising governments’ right to transport by air SALW, including through
private companies, as well as the existing regulations and the economic demands
relating to the air transport of goods;
Affirm that they are fully committed to preventing destabilising accumulations of
SALW through air transport and thus agree to the following Best Practices:
1. Scope
These Best Practices cover air transport of SALW, excluding those that are
transported by government, military or Government-chartered aircraft.
Participating States recognise that they assume full responsibility for transport by their
government, military, or Government-chartered aircraft and that they encourage other
States to assume the same responsibility.
